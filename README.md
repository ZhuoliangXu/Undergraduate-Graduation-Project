The document is my undergraduate project from Shanghai University of Science and Technology, focused on the application of fuzzy PID control in furnace temperature systems by using Matlab. It highlights problems in traditional PID control, such as poor accuracy and response delay, which limit its effectiveness in industrial furnace systems. The thesis proposes a fuzzy PID algorithm that combines fuzzy logic with PID control to enhance temperature control precision in systems like heating furnaces.
